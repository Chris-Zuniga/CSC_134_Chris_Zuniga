//This is the LAB 5 PROJECT (part 2)
//Assignment: Design and write a program using a while-loop that never ends(e.g. an infinite loop) and prints "This is infinite\n". NOTE: to stop the program, use Ctrl+c on your keyboard


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

int number = 0;
while (number < 10){

    std::cout << "This will go on forever, to stop you must hit control + c at the same time." << std::endl;
}
