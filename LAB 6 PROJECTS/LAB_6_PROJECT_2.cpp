//This is the LAB 5 PROJECT (part 2)
// Assignment: Design and write a program that accepts user input using cin for an integer value. 
//  After the user enters their value, use a for-loop to iterate over the integer and print out the number of iterations that occur. 
//  So for example, if you enter 5, the program should print 0 through 4 on the console.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

    int userInput;

    
    










return 0;
